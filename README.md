# Seoul Sisters' Asian Grocery Crud App by Lily Chen & Jihee Kim

SEI Project 3, March 2022 

APP URL: https://seoulsisters.netlify.app/ backend data: https://stark-shelf-08940.herokuapp.com/groceries/

GitHub frontend:https://github.com/herbie2568/grocery-frontend/ backend: https://github.com/herbie2568/grocery-backend

OVERALL APPROACH TAKEN: CRUD app where you can shop for various Asian groceries.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: React, Express, Mongoose, Javascript

SUCCESSES: The app is where you can shop for various Asian groceries. As soon as we tested its MVP working, we started to import outside react libraries, and successfully added each route. The one of our biggest success of this project was that we could make the login authentication to work, and only allow the users to access to edit, create, and delete. We both agreed that routes, and login auth are essential features for building an app, and we are so happy that we could add those features to our app. Also we added a search bar so the users can search specific items by its names. 

CHALLENGES: Setting up the routes, and adding loggin authentication were our coding challenges, but besides that, we also struggled with deploying our backend and frontend separately.

IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE: We want to improve our user data with having user info/profile to save the favorite button, and add items to the cart. Also add a filter feature for the users to filter by each catagory.
